### Introduction
I am not a big NBA fan, to be honest I have started to watch it during the last season.
Luckily, one of the first matches I watched was a Grizzlies game and I had no option but keep watching Ja and his gang.
As I have already said, I am not a real NBA fan so I only watched Grizzlies games. For that reason, I am going to analyze him and other point guards in order to know if there is someone like him someway.
